# Insurance-referee-assignment

The problem at the center of this courseâ€™s  project option were included in the ASP Challenge 2019Links to an external site.,Links to an external site. which invited companies to provide descriptions and instances of industrial problems from areas that are traditionally of interest to the community of answer set programming (ASP). The participants of the challenge were called upon to solve these and several other problems by means of ASP and extensions thereof. To this end, the participants were able to use any available ASP system to solve the problem at hand. 


Scenario: An insurance company needs to check whether customer claims are justified. To this end, the company sends referees (commonly referred to as insurance or claims "adjusters" in the United States) to different locations to inspect damages (e.g., damaged cars) and write reports. The insurance company employs its own referees (internal referees) but can also authorize external referees to handle cases when volume warrants. 

Challenge: The overall task is to assign referees to insurance cases according to various hard constraints and weak constraints using the clingo program to find the assignment satisfying the input constraints. This is a static world problem, meaning that the status of each object does not change over time (e.g., the payment of each case does not change over time).

Objective: Show that you can represent various hard and weak constraints in KR languages and automate reasoning using KR tools.
